# AM_I
An Interactive Robotics Installation

Are we our body, or are we what we perceive?
“AM I?” is an immersive robotics installation that explores self-perception and identity through real-time embodied interaction with cobots and VR technology. Originally showcased at Passagen Köln, the project places participants into an uncanny out-of-body experience—where they become the observer of themselves.

Concept
Using a Meta Quest 3 headset, participants control cobots equipped with stereoscopic cameras that mirror their real-time movements. This setup allows them to see themselves from an external robotic perspective, triggering a powerful sensory illusion and encouraging reflection on what defines human identity.

The experience intensifies when control and perspective are split: users find themselves piloting one cobot while perceiving the visual input of another. Combined with custom cobot voices and an ambient light-sound environment, “AM I?” becomes a multi-sensory experience of presence and disembodiment.
